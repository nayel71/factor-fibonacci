# Testing Primality of Fibonacci Numbers with Prime Index

It can be easily seen that Fibonacci numbers with composite index are composite. However, the converse is false. This program can find the least prime factor of a Fibonacci number whose index is prime. It relies on two functions `is_prime` and `fibonacci`, which I have left out in the file `factor.py`. In [Sage](https://www.sagemath.org), the functions are built in.
