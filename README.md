# Number Theory of Fibonacci Numbers

These are programs for studying some number-theoretic properties of Fibonacci numbers.

## Number Theory (`nt.py`)

This module contains some standard number-theoretic functions.

## Fibonacci Numbers with Prime Index (`fibonacci_prime.py`)

Fibonacci numbers with composite index greater than 4 are composite [[1]](#1). The converse however is false. This program can find the least prime factor and the prime factorisation (slow for large index) of Fibonacci numbers with prime index [[2]](#2).

## Pisano Period (`pisano.py`)

The Fibonacci sequence modulo `n` is periodic. The period is known as the *Pisano period* [[1]](#1). This program can find the length of the Pisano period modulo `n` [[3]](#3).
